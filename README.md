Tired of manually calculating how much tax you'll have to pay when you withdraw a particular amount of stocks from Fidelity ? 
This chrome extension will help you get an overview before withdrawing a said amount.


## Privacy
This extension reads the fidelity webpage to only display the tax liability inline. No data is collected, stored, transfered or used in any other way.

## Disclaimer
> This extension does not take into account the USD to INR currency exchange rates on the date of purchase. This is why the tax liability data is not 100% accurate. It is advised to check with one's CA for an accurate measure of the tax liability for income tax purposes.
